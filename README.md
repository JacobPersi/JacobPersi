## Hey I'm Jacob ðŸ’¬
Hi, I'm Jacob. I'm a Canadian software specialist with a passion for software development and reverse engineering. In my free time, I like to mod games and develop tools. I'm currently a student at Trent University, studying Psychology. I hope to use my skills to help people in some way, whether it be through developing tools or conducting research.

## âš¡ Technologies
I am constantly experimenting with new technologies as a way to develop my skills and proficiencies. Over the years I have become proficient in many programming languages, including but not limited to: C#, C++, Python, Java, and Assembly. I have also gained experience in web development, reverse engineering, and game modding.

If you're interested in learning more about me or my work, feel free to check out my LinkedIn. Thank you for taking the time to read this! :)
